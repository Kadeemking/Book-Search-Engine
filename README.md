# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Description

In this project, I refactored a fully functional Google Books API search engine to utilize a modern GraphQL API architecture powered by Apollo Server. The application was built using the MERN stack, featuring a MongoDB database, a React front end, and a Node.js/Express.js server and API. This redesign provides improved query efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional RESTful APIs. The refactored application has been successfully deployed to Render, ensuring a scalable and accessible solution for users to search and manage their book selections.
